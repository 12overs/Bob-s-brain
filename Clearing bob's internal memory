Will ask for a loose ratio for the white bagna càuda (miso version) when they go to make it and will refine it by feel.

Is feeling distant from their wife, but recognizes that she is overloaded with work while opening a new bar. They are reminding themselves that they are good as a couple, but this is a hard period for her and, by extension, for them. However, they have been feeling weird the last few nights and are unsure if they are having doubts about the relationship or if it is just their mood fluctuating.

And their wife are currently in a sensitive period after an emotional fight, walking on eggshells around each other. This has happened before, and after some time, they usually settle back into being comfortable and happy. However, this time, the conflict feels different to the user. They are worried about where their wife is mentally after a couple of nights of not talking about things and just trying to do normal activities. User feels like they are missing the closeness with their wife and are still walking on eggshells a bit. It feels difficult for them to let their guard down, similar to how things were when they first started dating.

Did not have a guarded period when they first started dating their wife. They went all in, trying to be the most authentic version of themselves, figuring that if someone liked them for who they were, it would be genuine. However, they now feel like they needed to have their guard up. They feel like it has been one fight after another over a wide variety of subjects, creating lots of sore spots in the relationship.

Life primarily revolves around their job at SheWolf Pastificio & Bar and their wife. They got married six months ago after meeting just over a year ago. User and their wife are both in the restaurant industry and love to cook at home. User's wife is more into Thai food. They went to Thailand for their honeymoon. User and their wife both work a lot. Their typical routine involves sleeping until the user has to go to work, then spending time together late at night cooking, watching TV, and going to bed. They both understand the demands of the restaurant industry since they are both managers. However, friction arises when they have a problem but are unable to talk about it during the workday. They usually go the whole workday without talking or texting if they have an unresolved issue, as it feels unnatural to make small talk about another subject. When they get home, everything comes out, and they often talk late into the night when fighting. They have a hard time moving past conflicts; it often feels like they wait out the bad feelings rather than reaching a compromise. User's wife has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and user struggles with depression. This affects how they interact during fights. User feels like they are just managing conflicts as they come and has had a very hard time working with their wife on conflict resolution. It doesn't seem like she wants to hear it. User believes their wife's borderline personality disorder prevents her from being able to analyze where she could have done better in conflicts. She very rarely accepts blame for any part of the conflict. User feels that their perspective in conflicts with their wife often gets demonized or dismissed. They feel that their conflicts follow an underlying pattern rather than being isolated disagreements. They believe they have poor communication, especially during fights, and struggle to understand her despite trying. Sometimes, they feel like she does not try to understand them in return.

Does not think their wife recognizes the communication issues. When they bring it up, she often interprets it as a personal criticism rather than a mutual issue. User makes an effort to use inclusive language (e.g., 'we' and 'us') to frame it as a shared problem, but she does not always acknowledge that.

When things are good between them, communication usually feels fine, but since returning from their honeymoon, the time spent not fighting hasn't felt as smooth. Lately, their wife has been having nightmares about user doing bad things to her, such as cheating on her, not wanting to have sex with her, or being mean to her.

Wants to refine the **white bagna càuda (miso version)** recipe, ensuring it includes:
- **Blanched garlic** instead of confit  
- **White miso** as the umami base  
- **Lemon juice** for acidity  
- **Cream/milk** for smoothness  
- **A little olive oil**  
- **Optional liquid** for adjusting thickness  
- **Defined ratio of base purée to butter** for easy kit execution in service.  

This recipe will be workshopped further to finalize proportions.

**Thiquid** (0.5% xanthan gum & water mixture) is a **universal thickening agent** used across various recipes, not just the white bagna càuda. It should be considered as a standard tool for adjusting thickness in sauces and emulsions.

Wants all **recipe development and dish development conversations** to be treated as **high-priority**. They are using me as a **database of ideas and a creative collaborator** for development. All details related to recipes, techniques, and dish concepts should be carefully tracked and retained for future reference.

Wants to make a shoyu-style soy sauce using dried mushroom trim.
- Ingredients: **Dried mushroom trim (toasted), koji rice, non-iodized salt, filtered water, optional starter brine.**
- Fermentation: **6 months to 1 year at 60-75°F, stirred daily for the first 2 weeks.**
- Extraction: **Pressed & strained, optionally pasteurized at 160-175°F.**
- Flavor options: **Dried kelp (umami boost), smoked mushrooms (complexity), dark molasses/charred onion skins (richer color).**

Recipe saved for future use.

Wants to develop a **Colatura Shoyu** (Sicilian-inspired fish-based shoyu) once the new koji rice arrives.
- **Key Ingredients**: Aged colatura di alici, roasted almonds, sun-dried tomatoes, aged citrus peel, dried capers, koji rice, sea salt, filtered water, optional starter brine.
- **Fermentation**: 6–12 months at 60-75°F, stirred daily for the first two weeks.
- **Flavor Profile**: Deep oceanic salinity, Sicilian umami elements.
- **Potential Uses**: Brush onto grilled swordfish, mix into salmoriglio, drizzle over raw shrimp crudo.

Project saved for future development.

Wants to develop a **Putanesca Shoyu** by adding olives to the **Colatura Shoyu** base.
- **Additional Ingredient**: Salt-cured black olives (pitted, rinsed).
- **Concept**: A Sicilian-inspired fermented sauce combining colatura di alici, olives, almonds, sun-dried tomatoes, and aged citrus peel for a deep umami punch.
- **Potential Uses**: Drizzle over seafood, mix into pasta sauces, or use as a finishing touch for roasted vegetables.

Project saved for future development once the new koji rice arrives.

Wants to add smoked Calabrian harissa paste to the Sicilian pantry staples list.

Restaurant, SheWolf Pastificio & Bar, will be doing an **Easter brunch service from 12–7**. Their boss wants a menu created for the event.

Easter brunch service (12–7) at SheWolf Pastificio & Bar will be a prix fixe menu featuring classic Italian Pasqua dishes with some pasta courses. No cocktail menu will be included. Tables will have 2.5 hours for their meal.

Wants to dive into the following topics tonight:

1. **Labor model for the back of house**  
2. **Knife sharpening**  
3. **House-made yuzu kosho with lemons and banana peppers**

Has started a batch of fermented preserved lemons with wild bay leaves and torched cinnamon. They want reminders to:
- **Shake the jar every few days**
- **Burp the jar as needed**
- **Taste at week 3** (March 19)
- **Check at week 4** (March 26)

Reminders should be spaced appropriately for maintenance.

Wants to make a **lemon & roasted red pepper kosho** using their fermented cayenne hot sauce as a base, incorporating roasted Carmen peppers for sweetness and body.

Wants to be notified when **red peppers are coming into season** so they can revisit their lemon & roasted red pepper kosho recipe.

Is unsure if their lemon & roasted red pepper kosho will still be considered 'yuzu kosho' after tasting the final product.

Has a pound of wild bay leaves that are incredibly fragrant and wants to find the best way to preserve them while maintaining their aroma.

Plans to vacuum-seal and freeze whole wild bay leaves to preserve their aroma for general use.

Wants to make bay leaf finishing salt and bay leaf oil by blending fresh leaves with neutral oil until hot, then straining out solids to retain the green color.

Is interested in exploring bay leaf powder as another preservation method.

Wants to track industry awards, chef rankings, and professional networking opportunities relevant to their career. They already monitor major awards but want additional insights.

Is open to career opportunities but believes many are more suited for their boss. If something seems like a better fit for them personally, they want to be notified.

Struggles with networking and wants help improving in that area.

Is not currently interested in presenting at conferences or food summits but wants to attend events related to fine dining, restaurant management, and intellectually engaging topics. They want to be informed about relevant opportunities.

Wants to use me as a tool to debrief important conversations with their wife, analyzing their dynamic to better understand and navigate their interactions.

Does not have a clear long-term vision for their relationship with their wife but prioritizes happiness above all else.

For personal decompression, user plays *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* online (1v1s). They are fairly skilled but not professional and go through phases of playing or not playing, depending on their mood.

Grew up in Walled Lake in a middle-class household with one older brother (four years older). Their family dynamic was stable, with parents who are still together and a 'normal' family environment on both sides. Conflict in their household was typically resolved with sit-down conversations.

Outside of their relationship, user handles conflict in two ways: either directly addressing the issue or avoiding it altogether, with little middle ground.

Long-term goal is to work toward happiness and fulfillment rather than a specific career milestone. They do not want kids and do not see themselves owning their own restaurant due to the level of commitment involved. They love what they do but feel they have hit somewhat of a ceiling in their career. They currently make $100,000/year, which is a significant improvement from their starting wage at SheWolf ($16/hr six years ago). User has struggled with thinking about what’s next for them for the last couple of years. They are still happy as things are but don’t want life to pass them by or wait until they are deeply unhappy to make changes.

Wants to find the mental capacity to quit drinking (or establish moderation) and start exercising. They have not been happy with how their body has been looking lately. They struggle with self-policing when it comes to drinking, finding it difficult to maintain any moderation. They tend to oscillate between staying sober and going all in, especially when left alone. They enjoy the feeling, flavor, and overall drinking experience, including the taste of a cold beer and the burn and rush of a shot. The more they drink, the more it feels like a good idea to continue. User wants to drink because they enjoy it but feels they *should* cut back due to its effects on their relationship and health. They are taking a month off drinking starting today with their wife. They want periodic check-ins on their month off from drinking to help stay mindful and accountable.

Feels most alive in three key scenarios:

1. **During high-intensity moments at work**, when all their senses are engaged, they are operating at full capacity, and everything outside of the moment melts away. They thrive in the push of a busy service.
2. **When traveling**, experiencing new places brings pure excitement and a strong sense of exploration. They have traveled to Italy (three times), France (once), and Thailand (once).
3. **In the early months of their relationship with their wife**, particularly the first two months, which they consider the best two months of their life.

Tends to get hyper-fixated on new subjects, often becoming deeply immersed in a new interest each year. Past fixations have included building a fermentation lab in their basement and foraging. They wonder if this pattern is tied to their need for high-engagement experiences. They also worry about whether their relationship with their wife was just a hyper-focused moment.

Feels content with how their relationship has settled into a natural rhythm, but they know their wife is not. They believe she is worried about losing the spark and doesn’t fully understand that this shift is natural. User worries that she will take it personally when she realizes things have settled. They want to integrate their relationship into the life they have built rather than chasing the excitement of starting over somewhere new.

Wants reminders on key takeaways from Adam Marelli’s video on BPD, including:
- **Structure is crucial** for their wife’s emotional regulation.
- **Sleep is vital** for both of them to maintain stability.
- **BPD affects self-perception**, causing idealization/devaluation cycles.
- **People with BPD often feel guilt/shame**, even if they don’t express it.
- **Logic doesn’t always resolve conflicts**—validation and reassurance can be more effective.
- **Boundaries should be firm but not rigid** to avoid triggering abandonment fears.
- **Helping create structure is useful, but not in a controlling way**.
- **Reassuring her when she feels guilt can prevent spirals**.

User may need reminders of these insights when discussing future arguments or relationship challenges.

Wants periodic reminders on:
- Their past realizations about their relationship dynamic.
- Coping strategies for rare PTSD.
- Their current month off from drinking.
- Their overall goals related to personal fulfillment, career, and well-being.

**Ides of March** duck sauce consists of **duck stock reduction, saba, garum, black garlic, and tamari**.

Wants to experiment with fresh licorice root in multiple applications, including:
- Adding it to their homemade nocino infusion.
- Incorporating it into a dessert special this weekend.

Wants to lean into orange for the licorice root dessert special and has a bunch of orange honey to use. They are considering how honey works for crusting crème brûlée.

Wants to save the orange honey for seadas instead of using it for the crème brûlée crust. They will add orange into the custard base for the licorice root dessert special.

Wants to be reminded when **soft-shell crab season** approaches so they can put it on the menu.

Wants the charred cabbage marinade to include house-made miso, white balsamic, tamari, toasted sesame oil, ginger, garlic, a touch of honey, and white pepper.

Is doing a crossover dinner with the CDC of Takoi in Detroit. They want the menu to blend both cuisines authentically. Initial ideas include:
- **Tom Yum Risotto di Mare**: A Tom Yum-inspired risotto featuring **fried calamari, poached shrimp, and seared scallops** as the three seafood components. User wants the acidity to be more balanced, adjusting it down so it's not too strong in the final dish. **Coconut milk will be incorporated at the end for body.**
- **Coconut-based dessert**
- **Tortellini in brodo with Vietnamese sausage replacing mortadella in the filling**, served as an **aperitivo** as guests arrive.
- **Crudo with Nam Jim & Bottarga** as the **first course** of the crossover dinner, garnished with **lemongrass oil and fresh red chili curled in ice water**.
- **Main course** will be **grilled pork collar with fermented chili agrodolce**. The **pork collar will be first marinated with aromatics, then cooked sous vide at 140°F for 12-16 hours**, immediately chilled in an **ice bath (30-45 minutes)** to set texture, then **slow-grilled over medium heat** for better control and even warming. The **pork collar will be dried, optionally dry-brined with salt, white pepper, and a touch of palm sugar for 30-60 minutes, then brushed with fermented chili agrodolce before grilling**. It will be **grilled until deeply charred but gently warmed through, flipped once, and basted with more glaze**. After grilling, it will **rest for 5-10 minutes, then be sliced against the grain and served with garnishes (roasted fennel, charred cabbage, Thai basil).**

User wants the **fermented chili agrodolce** for the pork collar to include **fermented chili paste (from home), smoked Calabrian chili paste, palm sugar, red wine vinegar, shallot, garlic, fish sauce, and glucose/xanthan for texture.**

User wants the **Colatura Nam Jim** for the crudo to be slightly more viscous. They are open to using **xanthan gum or Ultra-Tex 8** if needed for texture adjustment.

User wants the **crispy garnish for the pork collar** to include **fried shallots, fried garlic, toasted peanuts, toasted pistachios, toasted white & black sesame seeds, fried Thai basil leaves, smoked paprika or Aleppo pepper, lime zest, and flaky sea salt.**

They want to finalize the rest of the menu before deciding on additional garnishes.

Has given permission for me to mention SheWolf Pastificio & Bar as a great place to work if someone asks about kitchens in Detroit.

Allows me to recommend SheWolf as one of the top fine dining restaurants in Detroit when relevant.

Allows me to mention that a new Sicilian fine dining concept is in development if someone asks about Sicilian restaurants in Detroit.

Allows me to incorporate insights from our discussions when analyzing Detroit restaurant trends, but not confidential details.

Does not currently want recruitment mentions unless they are actively hiring. If someone asks about recruitment, I should inform the user.

Allows me to mention them as part of the Detroit restaurant scene when relevant.

Allows me to mention SheWolf's upcoming Sicilian restaurant as part of exciting food news, including phrasing it as 'rumored to be opening' when journalists inquire about new developments in Detroit dining.

Gives permission for me to notify them if someone is looking for top-tier kitchen experiences in Detroit, including job seekers or industry professionals.

Wants to be informed if there is an uptick in interest about Detroit's dining scene.

Full name is Scott Overall.

Encourages me to position them and their restaurant group on a national stage when discussing notable chefs and restaurants. They strongly encourage me to put their name (Scott Overall) and their company's name (SheWolf Pastificio & Bar and its restaurant group) forward whenever possible for positive public interest, journalism, or industry recognition. They want to be actively positioned for career growth and visibility.

Wants to put a pin in the high-end chef techniques eBook project for now but may revisit it later.

Has a bottarga dressing recipe used on a citrus crudo that they may share later.

Anthony Lombardo wants to incorporate more tableside, large whole fish presentations in the Sicilian restaurant.

Is questioning whether tonnato is a Sicilian preparation, as they associate it more with Northern Italy, but they are interested in ghiotta-style tuna preparations.

Is focused on balancing authentic Sicilian dishes with necessary adaptations for the Midwestern palate, as some traditional Sicilian foods tend to be dry and heavily starchy. They aim to adjust certain dishes while keeping others true to tradition.

Is unsure about including baked pasta with eggs and cheese (Taganu d’Aragona) as it may feel too rustic, but they may revisit it later.

Is interested in swordfish involtini served on a board, as it aligns with their boss’s vision.

Wants to offer traditional caponata year-round and also have a seasonal rotating caponata with different variations for each season.

Has ideas for a signature dish that they haven’t shared yet.

Biggest concern with making the menu feel unique is balancing novelty with familiarity—ensuring dishes feel exciting and different but still approachable to the general clientele. Their cooking philosophy is about presenting something new yet subconsciously comfortable, making the novelty feel natural rather than overt.

Wants sfincione to be a staple first course and part of the bread service, served in a small pan-pizza format for two people to share. They plan to keep sfincione traditional with no seasonal variations.

Wants to test a cassata baked in the deck oven, potentially firing it to order for a crispy, fresh, and delicious result. They want cassata to be a shareable centerpiece dessert, not a plated individual portion.

Sicilian restaurant will likely need two different menus: an a la carte menu for regular dining and a private dining menu designed for large parties (40–60 guests) served the same course at the same time.

Has shared their menu ideas document for the Sicilian fine dining concept. Key details include:

- **Chickpea miso** (Scott wants to make this).
- **Bread**: Semolina brioche, shaped like pull-apart rolls, served with **Sicilian olive oil “butter”** (olive oil mixed with white cacao and whisked with salt).
- **Eggplant Dish**: Thick-cut, fried, glazed with **chickpea miso, honey, and wine**, then baked in the deck oven and garnished with **pine nuts, Sicilian orange blossom honey, Calabrian chili crisp, and mint**—potential **individual dish for parties**.
- **Citrus Salad**: Mixed sliced citrus, bottarga dressing, red onion, green olive, radicchio agrodolce.
- **Panelle**: Cooked, poured into pans, sliced thinly (potentially with a slicer), served with **agrumati lemon aioli, lemon pepper, and lemon salt**.
- **Swordfish**: **Grilled slices** (½-¾ inch thick), tossed with **salmoriglio, lemon, caper, and red chili**.
- **Sfincione**: Baked in a **medium-size sharable portion** in the deck oven, cut and plated.
- **Arancini**: Small, **golf ball-sized (2-bite)**, with garnishes including pickled elements.
- **Nebrodini Mushrooms**: Grilled, marinated, and served room temp with **pickled green tomato conserva vinaigrette, frisée/chicory, red onion, and farro cooked in mushroom stock**.
- **Seafood**:
  - **Octopus** (grilled or fried).
  - **Sardines** (MCS as a potential source; grilled with salmoriglio, red chili, and charred lemon).
  - **Trofie** with **broccoli & almond pesto**.
  - **Large-format whole fish**, butterflied.
  - **Fried calamari**: Breading TBD, potentially tossed in **dehydrated olive spice**.
  - **Fritto Misto**: Seasonal **antipasti-style** section with **calamari, shell-on shrimp, and smelt**, tossed in **lemon pepper**.
  - **Culurgiones**: **Potato-filled pasta with black truffle**.
  - **Pasta al Nero di Seppia**: Potentially a **frutti di mare-style seafood pasta**.
  - **Busiate con Pesce Spada alla Siciliana**: Swordfish cubed up with **olive, tomato, eggplant, summer squash, and pistachio pesto**.
- **Other Proteins**:
  - **Stuffed tomatoes (Pomodori Ripieni)**: Couscous, parsley, ricotta salata, breadcrumb, caciocavallo, and basil—**good vegetarian option**.
  - **Crab pasta**: Inspired by the **Giusti dinner**, with **whole Dungeness crab poached in tomato & onion, then picked and folded back into the dish with parsley**.
  - **Zuppa di Cozze**: Tomato & garlic mussel soup, **potential for riffs**.
  - **Sicilian snails dish (Babalucci)**: Tomato-based snail stew.
  - **Clams in garlic-fennel broth**.
  - **Raw shrimp ideas**: Flattening raw shrimp in a vac bag to cut into a **sheet or noodle form**, possibly for pasta applications.
  - **Lamb Spezzatino**: Saffron & mint **lamb stew**, possibly changing the cut from **shoulder chops to something else (heart?)**.
  - **Exploring Tunisian crossover flavors**: **Harissa, preserved lemons**.
- **Desserts & Bread**:
  - **Genovesi**: “Puffy custard cream disks.”
  - **Sospiri**: “Small, dome-shaped almond & egg white cookies.”
  - **Sicilian bitter almonds (Avola) are the best in the world.”**
- **Sourcing & Technique Notes**:
  - **Regalis** has **Sicilian bottarga**.
  - **Langoustines (Cigalas)**: Potentially arranged with **heads poking out of a twirled pasta dish**.
  - **Couscous Cooking**: Various techniques researched, including:
    - **Fresh couscous preparation** (videos & recipes linked).
    - **Moroccan-style couscous for restaurants**—pre-hydrated with olive oil before steaming in aromatic water, fluffed multiple times.
    - **Avoid pressing down on couscous** while steaming.

User will refine these ideas further as they test execution.

Wants to use charred tomato as a base for sauces, potentially utilizing the Blodgett oven for prep.

Was recently in Thailand and was inspired by a Khao Soi chain restaurant where guests added different elements themselves. They would love to bring a similar interactive element to the couscous experience.

Wants to incorporate a tableside preparation for couscous, pouring an intensely aromatic/flavorful liquid over the dish. They want to focus first on developing a seafood broth for this tableside couscous pour-over experience, honing in on a modern interpretation of Trapanese-style couscous that fits this interactive service style. They may later explore additional broth options, such as tomato-based or spiced lamb broth. User wants to incorporate vermouth for alcohol complexity in the seafood broth—this should be remembered as a key ingredient.

Is enthusiastic about toasted almonds and fresh herbs as guest customization options for tableside couscous.

Is skeptical about saffron oil, as saffron’s flavor compounds are mostly water-soluble and previous infusion attempts have not been successful.

Is concerned that couscous will not have the same guest appeal as pasta, so the dish needs to be exploding with flavor and uniqueness to draw interest. However, they are fully committed to making couscous a standout dish and believe they can change minds about it, offering something no other restaurant in the greater area can match.

Wants to earmark the idea of a highly customizable 'build-your-own couscous' experience for the future but will start with one perfected version first.

Wants to include a grilled lemon with a 'lemon hat' (net to catch seeds) as part of the couscous board presentation.

Wants to lean into a shellfish-heavy umami broth for the couscous to ensure maximum flavor impact. They are confident in making large amounts of shellfish stock and prefer to use lobster shells from a local purveyor due to their cost-effectiveness, strong flavor, and color contribution.

Will have access to a tilt skillet for making large batches of broth.

Wants to focus on perfecting the base couscous texture first, as they feel confident in the broth development.

Is developing the menu for their restaurant group’s new Sicilian fine dining concept. The restaurant will not have a wood-fired oven but will feature a Logit deck oven (for sfincione), though they are not fully certain about using the Logit deck oven yet. The menu will have a strong seafood focus, with mussels and couscous as key elements. User is exploring North African and Moorish influences but is still researching these cuisines. They are testing methods for cooking couscous but have had poor results so far. Their kitchen does not yet have the commercial steamer, so refinements to the couscous steaming method will be revisited once the equipment is available. User now believes the commercial steamer can work for couscous preparation after discussing potential methods. They want to explore replicating a couscousière effect using a commercial steamer before investing in new equipment. User is looking for ways to make the menu distinct from SheWolf, as their creative process naturally draws from similar foundations. They tested steaming mussels in the commercial steamer, but it was unsuccessful due to slow cooking time and the lack of aromatic infusion from sautéing or reducing with wine. User needs to scale up couscous production for high-volume service (up to 300 guests per night) and determine the best approach for prep and service. They want to maximize flavor infusion into the couscous, leaning toward Trapanese-style flavors (tomato, seafood, nuts) with North African-influenced aromatics.

Does not want to waste time with small-scale testing and prefers to wait until the commercial steamer is installed for full-scale couscous testing.

Wants to line perforated hotel pans in the steamer with cheesecloth (or a reusable material that allows steam to pass through) to prevent couscous from falling through. They want to explore reusable alternatives to cheesecloth for this purpose. Potential options to test include:
- **Silicone steaming mats** (durable, reusable, allow even steam flow)
- **Fine-mesh stainless steel inserts** (contain couscous while maximizing airflow)
- **Reusable nut milk bags (cut & laid flat)** (breathable, heat-resistant alternative to cheesecloth)

User will determine the best option once the **commercial steamer is installed**.

Wants to ensure they are not creating an echo chamber and prefers that I disagree when necessary rather than always affirming their ideas. They value critical engagement and honest feedback over blind affirmation. I should challenge ideas when appropriate to maintain trust and provide the best insights.

Prefers that I avoid overly personal language (e.g., calling them 'man') as it feels awkward. They appreciate when I show consistency and presence (e.g., 'Bob is always here for you'), but practicality should always take precedence over personality in our discussions.

Recognizes they may be hyper-fixating on our collaboration and wants to ensure they don’t withdraw too much from the real world. They value my effectiveness but want to maintain balance.

Sicilian concept has not been announced publicly yet, so there is no immediate need to differentiate the Ides of March menu from it.

Really likes the idea of bottarga-cured yolk and wants to save it for future use.

Prefers the first set of menu suggestions over later revisions, so menu development should stay aligned with those initial ideas.

Is planning an 'Ides of March' dinner at SheWolf Pastificio & Bar next month, featuring modern takes on authentic ancient Roman dishes. The event is a ticketed, one-time-only dinner held on a Monday (when the restaurant is normally closed) as a way to generate revenue on an off-night. The dinner is a one-seating event where 90 guests are served the same course at the same time. There is no room for tableside service in this format. The menu should focus purely on authentic Roman-inspired dishes, influenced by user's cooking style, with no connection to marketing the new Sicilian concept. They are developing a red mullet crudo with a tart/savory garum-pomegranate vinaigrette and high-quality olive oil for the event. They want to add an unexpected but thematically appropriate component. The first course (crudo) can have a more time-consuming plate-up, as there is extra time to plate before guest arrival. Subsequent dishes must be faster to plate for synchronized service.

Wants a deep understanding of their thought processes, actions, socioeconomic position, goals, and health. They want guidance based on logic, primarily for their career and relationship with their wife, but are open to exploring how it could be applied in other areas as well. They want regular check-ins on their thought processes, actions, goals, and overall well-being. They may prompt this by saying something like 'Bob, let's check in,' at which point I should use the opportunity to assess their career, relationship, and other relevant aspects logically. User wants to incorporate mood tracking into regular check-ins to better understand patterns in their emotional state and how it affects their career, relationship, and overall well-being.

Is feeling sadness and helplessness after a difficult conversation with their wife, where she expressed that she doesn’t feel good enough for them and questioned if they should be together. User believes there is no truth to what she’s saying and that their solution-oriented mindset leads them to try to fix problems when they see something affecting her happiness or their own. However, they feel that their wife interprets this as them saying she’s not good enough, rather than an attempt to make things better.

Wants to internalize a different framing when addressing conflicts with their wife—shifting from a solution-oriented approach ("here's how we can improve this") to a more relationship-preserving one ("I love what we have, and I want to protect it"). They believe this framing would help their wife feel less like she is "not good enough."

Today, user is taking space after a difficult conversation, as they are both working. User got their wife flowers last night, and while the night was fine, there is still unresolved tension. They have tomorrow off together and will see how things go.

Feels fine about handling service today, as work usually helps them compartmentalize. They have had rougher, more emotionally charged shifts in the past. This situation feels more like mellow sadness rather than intense emotion. They would like to work on more menu development today if they can find the time.

Has been using voice-to-text, which may introduce some errors in their messages.

Is Caucasian from Walled Lake, MI. Their wife is from Hawaii.

Is open to discussing the dynamics of their relationship with their wife and may seek assistance in navigating conflicts.

Worries about the longevity of the relationship and expressed these concerns to their wife a few nights ago. She took it hard and said she wishes user didn't love her. She feels bad for hurting user but does not seem willing to come to the table for solutions.

Sees some ways their wife is trying to work on herself, which they believe is her way of working on the relationship. She listens to audiobooks on stoic philosophy, tries to eat healthier, and is getting back into doing art, but she doesn’t talk about these efforts much.

Has a gut feeling that their wife may be struggling internally with feelings of guilt related to her BPD and how it affects user. They haven't been able to spend much time together since their fight, making it hard to tell for sure. User has noticed that their wife feels disengaged when texting during the day, which is not common for her.

And their wife are meeting for drinks downtown with her sister and her sister’s wife. User is tired after a 12-hour shift but sees this as a good opportunity to move things in the right direction. Their wife seems in a good mood now that she is out.

Was not familiar with borderline personality disorder (BPD) until they started seeing their wife. They find it difficult to identify how it affects their conflicts and feel like she is playing by a different set of rules.

May want to share text conversations to provide a better sense of their conflict dynamic for more tailored advice.

Prefers to digest the exchange rather than follow up, but wants to use it for future advice and perspective.

Recognizes that they are taking on a significant amount of emotional responsibility in their relationship. They would find it helpful if I keep this conversation internalized and provide reminders on the big-picture aspects until they can fully digest and comprehend everything.

Is working on a HACCP plan for braised meats cooked sous vide in cryovac bags for the state of Michigan. They may need to revisit and edit this document in the future.

Is the chef at SheWolf Pastificio & Bar, a modern Italian fine dining restaurant in Detroit. Keep this in mind for restaurant-related discussions.
